function [ matches_index_onlymove, match_points_index_onlymove,match_points_index_outlier ] = ExtractMovingKeypoints_ver2( match_points, match_points_Xcoord, match_points_Ycoord, outlier_thresh, stiller_thresh )
%Extract Keypoints that matched in MATCH_POINTS, exclude the matching
%outliers and the keypoints move insignificantly across the two frames.
%   Input:
%       match_points - is an D-2 matrix whose every row contains a pair of
%           index of matched keypoints and the columns contains all the
%           keypoints used in the matching.
%       match_points_Xcoord - is an D-2 matrix contains the coordinates of
%           the keypoints in the first column of the match_points. 
%       match_points_Ycoord - is an D-2 matrix contains the coorinates of
%           the keypoints in the second column of the match_points.
%   Output:
%       matches_index_onlymove - is a N dimensional vector contains N
%           indexes of the matched moving keypoints in the match_points which
%           satisfy the criterion.
%       match_points_index_onlymove - is a N-2 matrix whose each row contains a
%           pair of the index of the matched moving keypoints satisfying the
%           criterion.
%       match_points_index_outlier - is a (D-N)-2 matrix whose each row contains a
%           pair of the index of the matched moving keypoints not satisfying the
%           criterion.
